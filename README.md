### Hi there, I'm Kyle ğŸ‘‹

I am a creative, detail-oriented, and passionate software engineer who is obssesed with turning ideas into reality. Whether it be planning or architecting the "big-picture", devising creative solutions, or focusing on the minute details, I am always excited to build off of an idea that is genuine.
